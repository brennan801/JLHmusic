        <h1>Lopez Hunter Music Policies</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you so much for taking the time to study or consider studying with me! I am lucky to have 
            the privilege of working with so many talented students! Please take some time to familiarize 
            yourself with a bit of information about how I generally run lessons and let me know if you have 
            any questions!
        </p>
        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Flute: If purchasing, please talk to me first. A good instrument can make a huge difference 
                and I can help you find a quality instrument (new or used) that will fit your budget.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure you have a cleaning rod and cloth as well!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Metronome/Tuner: You can purchase a physical metronome, tuner, or metronome-tuner combination. 
                You can find inexpensive ones at any music store or online. There are also awesome free apps 
                that do the exact same job! If you’re unsure of what to purchase, feel free to ask me!
            </li>
            <li>
                Music Stand (for home practice): You can find these in stores or online. Students are welcome 
                to purchase fairly inexpensive collapsible stands, but keep in mind that these give little 
                support for bigger books and tip over easily. A nicer metal stand may be a good investment. 
                Again, feel free to ask me for recommendations. 
            </li>
            <li>
                3-ring binder: .5 inches or larger, used for handouts and loose sheet music
            </li>
            <li>
                Sheet music, as assigned: I prefer to ask students to buy as they need rather than from a 
                required list! Some music can be found on Amazon. If you cannot find it there, 
                <a href="https://www.fluteworld.com/">Flute World</a> is always a great option for music, 
                instruments, and accessories.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tuition/Prices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lessons are taught in 30 minute, 45 minute, or 60 minute slots
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I try to keep my prices affordable for all students while still representing my own 
                    experience and skills: I currently charge $15 for 30 min. lesson, $18 for 45 min., and 
                    $22 for 60 min.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Lesson prices may change if travel is required of me, but I try to keep this minimal!
            </li>
            <li>
                Tuition for the month is due on the last lesson of each month (cash, check, or Venmo are all fine)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is important to attend lessons as regularly as possible, as progress happens with consistency!
            </li>
            <li>
                If a conflict arises, please let me know ASAP and at least within 24 hours of the lesson, so we 
                can cancel or reschedule. For lessons that are canceled or rescheduled within 24 hours, the full 
                cost of the lesson will still be applied to the month’s balance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please do your best to reschedule rather than cancel. It makes a big difference in student progress 
                over time when they have consistent, frequent lessons! Because my schedule is crazy, I understand 
                that yours is too! I would love to work with you to find times that fit your life, even if that 
                changes frequently.
            </li>
            <li>
                I do teach online lessons! For in-person students, this is a great option if you are ever unable to 
                appear in-person for a lesson.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I am always grateful for parents who support and encourage their students in practicing and performing. 
                The more a student puts in, the better they will become and the more they will love it!
            </li>
            <li>
                Practice time varies for each student depending on age and skill level. However, most students will be 
                asked to practice somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes a day, 6 days a week. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Don’t worry! This is very doable and in lessons we will discuss how to practice, how to use time 
                        efficiently, and what to work on.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Listening</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One of the most important things all musicians do is listen!
            </li>
            <li>
                Students are asked to listen to at least 30 minutes of flute or related music a week, which can take the place of up to 30 minutes of practice time. Some of this listening should be dedicated to pieces the student is working on, but they are also free to explore other selections. I will help you know what to listen to, and give you suggestions of great recordings or artists. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Open Studio</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Parents are welcome to be present for lessons if their student feels more comfortable with them there. For very young students, parents will generally be asked to attend every lesson. No matter what, I ask parents to  attend the first lesson to get acquainted with the set-up and to have any questions answered. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Students are welcome to observe one another if they desire and if it is not a hindrance to the student being taught. It is always a wonderful opportunity to hear one another play and cheer each other on.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Performances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We will likely have a couple of in-person (for in-person students) and online (for online students) recitals each year. Performing is a huge part of being a musician and we all benefit from hearing one another. Students should attend to support others and enjoy good music.
            </li>
        </ul>
