        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Flute: If purchasing, please talk to me first. A good instrument can make a huge difference 
                and I can help you find a good quality instrument (new or used).
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure you have a cleaning rod and cloth
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Metronome/Tuner: You can purchase a physical metronome, tuner, or metronome-tuner combination. 
                There are also awesome free apps that do the exact same job! I prefer to have a physical met 
                and tuner where possible, but it is up to you to decide what you would like. They can be fairly 
                cheap in any music store or online. If you’re unsure of what to purchase, feel free to ask me!
            </li>
            <li>
                Music Stand (for home practice): You can find these in stores or online. Students are welcome 
                to purchase fairly inexpensive collapsible stands, but keep in mind that these can be frustrating 
                to work with, tip over easily, give little support for bigger books, and don’t last very long. 
                A nicer metal stand may be a good investment. Again, feel free to ask me for recommendations. 
            </li>
            <li>
                3-ring binder: .5 inches or larger, used for handouts and loose sheet music
            </li>
            <li>
                Sheet music, as assigned: It is important for each student to have their own music rather. 
                I prefer to ask students to buy as they need rather than from a required list.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tuition</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lessons are taught in 30 minute, 45 minute, or 60 minute slots
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    $13 for 30 min. lesson, $15 for 45 min., and $17 for 60 min.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Lesson prices may change if travel is required of me or if I agree to work with a very 
                young student, but I try to keep this as minimal as possible
            </li>
            <li>
                Tuition for the month is due on the last lesson of each month (cash, check, or Venmo are all fine).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is important to attend lessons as regularly as possible. I cannot help you improve if 
                I never see you!
            </li>
            <li>
                If a conflict arises, please let me know ASAP and at least within 24 hours of the lesson, 
                so we can cancel or reschedule. After 3 times, a $5 fee will be applied to the month's 
                balance for cancellations or rescheduling that happens within 24 hours of a lesson.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please do your best to reschedule rather than cancel. Life is crazy, but attendance 
                is so important for progression. (I would love to work with you ahead of time if you 
                know a crazy month is coming and your normal times may not work.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Online lessons are usually not preferable, but they are a great option to have a remote 
                lesson while on vacation, sick, or otherwise unable to appear in person.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Parents should help students remain accountable for practice time. I can only teach 
                so much to a student who doesn’t practice, and the limit comes pretty quick. The more 
                a student puts in, the better they will become and the more they will love it!
            </li>
            <li>
                Practice time varies for each student depending on age and skill level. However, 
                most students will be asked to practice somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes a day, 
                6 days a week. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Don’t worry! This is very doable and in lessons we will discuss how to 
                        practice, how to use time efficiently, and what to work on.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Listening</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One of the most important things all musicians do is listen!
            </li>
            <li>
                Students are asked to listen to at least 30 minutes of flute or related music a week, 
                which can take the place of up to 30 minutes of practice time. Some of this listening 
                should be dedicated to pieces the student is working on, but they are also free to 
                explore other selections. A list of great performers or works to start with will be 
                given to each student. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Open Studio</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Parents are welcome to be present for lessons if their student feels more comfortable 
                with them there. No matter what, I ask parents to  attend the first lesson to get 
                acquainted with the set-up and to have any questions answered. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Students are welcome to observe one another if they so desire and if it is not a 
                hindrance to the student being taught. It is always a wonderful opportunity to hear 
                one another play and cheer each other on.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Performances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We will likely have a couple of in-person recitals each year for those students 
                studying in-person. Online recitals may also be scheduled for online students. 
                Performing is a huge part of being a musician and we all benefit from hearing one 
                another. Students are expected to attend these. 
            </li>
        </ul>
