        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Flute: If purchasing, please talk to me first. A good instrument can make a huge difference 
                and I can help you find a good quality instrument (new or used).
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure you have a cleaning rod and cloth
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Metronome/Tuner: You can purchase a physical metronome, tuner, or metronome-tuner combination. 
                There are also awesome free apps that do the exact same job! I prefer to have a physical met 
                and tuner where possible, but it is up to you to decide what you would like. They can be fairly 
                cheap in any music store or online. If you’re unsure of what to purchase, feel free to ask me!
            </li>
            <li>
                Music Stand (for home practice): You can find these in stores or online. Students are welcome 
                to purchase fairly inexpensive collapsible stands, but keep in mind that these can be frustrating 
                to work with, tip over easily, give little support for bigger books, and don’t last very long. 
                A nicer metal stand may be a good investment. Again, feel free to ask me for recommendations. 
            </li>
            <li>
                3-ring binder: .5 inches or larger, used for handouts and loose sheet music
            </li>
            <li>
                Sheet music, as assigned: It is important for each student to have their own music rather. 
                I prefer to ask students to buy as they need rather than from a required list.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tuition</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Lessons are taught in 30 minute, 45 minute, or 60 minute slots
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    $13 for 30 min. lesson, $15 for 45 min., and $17 for 60 min.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Lesson prices may change if travel is required of me or if I agree to work with a very 
                young student, but I try to keep this as minimal as possible
            </li>
            <li>
                Tuition for the month is due on the last lesson of each month (cash, check, or Venmo are all fine).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is important to attend lessons as regularly as possible. I cannot help you improve if 
                I never see you!
            </li>
            <li>
                If a conflict arises, please let me know ASAP and at least within 24 hours of the lesson, 
                so we can cancel or reschedule. After 3 times, a $5 fee will be applied to the month's 
                balance for cancellations or rescheduling that happens within 24 hours of a lesson.
            </li>
        </ul>
