                <h1>About Lopez Hunter Music</h1>
                <p>
                    Music is amazing because it gives us a way to express ourselves and better understand the world 
                    around us. One of my favorite things about music is that it is interdisciplinary. 
                    That means that when we study music, we study lots of other things like physics, 
                    biology, math, art, foreign language, technology, and culture.
                    Learning music strengthens students mentally, emotionally, and even physically. 
                </p>
                <p>

                <h1>About Julia Lopez Hunter</h1>
                <p>
                    Julia Lopez Hunter recently graduated from Snow College with her Bachelor of Music 
                    with an Emphasis in Commercial Music. She began playing flute in sixth grade, and 
                    has been in love with music and music education ever since. Julia is trained 
                    primarily as a classical flute player, but she also loves delving into other 
                    instruments, genres, and fields of music. She especially enjoys learning about the 
                    violin, voice, jazz/commercial music, music technology, and business. She has had 
                    the great pleasure of studying under amazing private instructors such as Margie 
                    Halling, Elaine Jorgensen, Christina Castellanos, Susan Huff, and Kathy Hunter. 
                    She is incredibly grateful for the immense knowledge gained from these women and 
                    all her professors at Snow College.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since learning flute, Julia has participated in groups such as wind bands, symphony 
                    orchestras, pit orchestras, chamber ensembles, commercial music ensembles, and 
                    choirs. She hopes to continue to perform throughout her entire life. She loves music 
                    education and is grateful for the two years she helped lead the Snow College chapter 
                    of CNAfME (Collegiate National Association for Music Education). In the past few 
                    years, she has fulfilled her passion for teaching and music as a physics tutor for 
                    Snow College, a beginning flute teacher at Ephraim Middle School, and a private 
                    lesson teacher. Having completed her degree, Julia is now pursuing her K-12 teaching 
                    license through Weber State University. She hopes to teach music in the public schools 
                    and maintain a studio of private flute students. In her personal life, she loves 
                    spending time with her friends and family, reconnecting with her heritage, attempting 
                    to cook with her husband, and learning about other cultures.
