                <h1>About Julia Lopez Hunter</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Julia (or Mrs. Lopez Hunter). 
                    I have been playing the flute for 10 years now and I love it! I also love teaching. 
                    I am just starting my senior year at Snow College studying music education. 
                    While at Snow, I’ve loved tutoring a physics class for musicians and teaching flute at Ephraim Middle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music is amazing because it gives us a way to express ourselves and better understand the world 
                    around us. One of my favorite things about music is that it is interdisciplinary. 
                    That means that when we study music, we study lots of other things like physics, 
                    biology, math, art, foreign language, technology, and culture.
                    Learning music strengthens students mentally, emotionally, and even physically. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why join my studio? I love teaching and I am dedicated to helping my students progress. 
                    The flute is a versatile instrument that is found in lots of different genres: classical, pop,
                    religious (you can play in church!), jazz, world music, and many others! 
                    As you join me for lessons, I will give you the tools to become a better musician
                    who can perform frequently and confidently. No matter where you are or where you want to be, 
                    I’m here to help you reach your goals and grow into an even more wonderful musician! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to schedule a free trial lesson or contact me with any question you may have!
